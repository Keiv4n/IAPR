Lab 1:
Proposed the algorithm for image segmentation of a tissue sample from mucinous adenocarcinoma in colorectal cancer.

Lab 2:
Implemented clustering of handwritten digits using a combination of contour-based, Fourier-based, and region-based descriptors.

Lab 3:
Developed a framework for out-of-distribution detection in colorectal cancer histology and cervical cell classification from Pap smear tests.

Final Project:
Employed techniques to solve tiling puzzles that automatically reconstruct the complete image from a single input image.
